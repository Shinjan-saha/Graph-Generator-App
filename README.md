# What is  this project:-

An  Flutter App Where we Can Create a X & Y Axis graph with decimal Points.We can add as many as Curve or Line we want in a single graph.So  while plotting graphs for  our Lab Experiments We Often faced Problem in getting the exact nature of the graphs, so to get the exact nature the graph, like whether decreasing or increasing,I have created an Flutter App,which will be helpful for getting the nature & plot of the Graph, as sometimes points on both x-axis & y-axis are on decimals & data set gets huge which sometimes become frustrating to plot graphs & this might be a problem as in certain Experiments graphs are of utmost importance to get the conclusion of the whole Experiment

## User Stories
